        <p class="container" id="article"> This was our first year programming the robot in Java. Drew setup Java by himself in about a week, whereas some other teams spent up to a summer trying to set it up. Previously, the team has used Labview, a drag-and-drop application for programming. Drew wrote all of the basic code for the robot, with some help from Matthew, our new programming mentor.
            <br><br> With this code, the robot was driving very easily and all of the pneumatics were working smoothly. We had enough code to drive the robot pretty much as soon as the robot was built. Michael then wanted to join in with the programming and asked what the drive team would want for each of the buttons, such as toggles and single presses. Once the drive team had the controls as they preferred, the programming team went on to try to get cameras and autonomous modes working. Cameras were a bit finicky, and the programming team didnâ€™t have enough access to the robot to successfully figure out an autonomous.
            <br><br> Once we were done with the St. Joseph competition, we had a basic autonomous, so we worked on the programming for a new gear mechanism (****See page here****). We also tried to clean up the code from one file to several classes. We learned a lot about how classes can help organize code and make it much more readable.
            <br><br> Over the off-season the programming team will attempt to get visual processing ready for use for the next season. Also, if there is time, Michael would like to make a better looking dashboard for the drive team that has more features.</p>
