        <p class="container" id="article">At the start of the season, we met with many other teams for the game reveal at Lake Michigan College. It was pretty cool. They had speakers from large companies such as Whirlpool and some car companies talking about job opportunities at their companies in the STEM field. They had some other speakers talk, then the game reveal began. We learned that the game was about getting fuel into boilers and gears into the airship. Honestly, the 2017 season’s game was really unique. We talked strategy for a while, and decided that we would try to aim for getting gears. <br><br>At our first meeting at the lab, we developed our plan even further by prototyping the mechanism we would use to get the gears. We came up with several ideas, but the most prominent one involved dropping the gear into a slot then releasing the bottom of the container when the gear was ready to be put on the airship. <br><br>A few meetings in, we started on the main frame of the robot. This was pretty basic stuff, but it’s very important. Once, that was done, we started to wire up the parts of the robot. It was messy at first, then some of us cleaned it up quite a bit. Later in the season it got pretty messy again, and that’s not very easy to prevent. Hopefully, in the 2018 season, we can do better on that. <br><br>Eventually, we finished a gear mechanism, and had enough code to practice driving for the competition. The driving took a little while to get used to and the gear mechanism took quite a bit of tweaking before it worked correctly.<br><br> <span class="flex"><img src="/Images/Robot.jpg" alt="2017 Robot"></span> <br>After all of this work, we decided we were ready enough that we could risk working on a shooter for fuel. This didn’t take long, thanks to Sam. He finished almost it single-handedly and adjusted it until it was extremely accurate. <br><br>We then bagged up the robot, and prepared for competition.</p>
